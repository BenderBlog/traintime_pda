   Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
   Feel at home in our black conventicle
   As we anathematise all those who oppose us

   Don't summon the devil, don't call the priests
   If you need the strength, the conjuring
   Obey!

   Behold, the flames rise from the compass' cardinal points
   Burn the sacred oil, and with the ashes you'll anoint
   Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
   Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position
   Between its leaves place the lash from a black cat's eye
   A straw of a broom, fold, and burn, and centralize

   Don't summon the devil, don't call the priests
   If you need the strength, then conjure me

   I am the devil's advocate, salesman if you will
   You know my name, you know my name
   I met your father years ago, I gave him what he'd please
   He called my name, and you'll do the same
   I'm claiming what is mine by right, it's time to close the deal
   You're bought and sold, bought and sold
   Come join me in my infernal depths, Mephisto's hall of fame
   I've got your soul, I've got your soul

   Man, what are you thinking of?
   Man, what do you need?
   Man, nobody tell you what to do.
   Man, you need somebody to hurt?

   In a rainy night, can you hear me?
   In a rainy night, can you help me?

   Man, you feel so lonely.
   Man, can't you hear the message come from the sky?
   Man, you are driving into the rain.
   Man, you know it's time to find the faith?

   In a rainy night, can you hear me?
   In a rainy night, can you help me?
