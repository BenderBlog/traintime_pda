Also feauring a short story:

Once upon a time, there's a 'Hard Lovin' Man called Ray, whose understand the power of the Railgun called 'Flight of the Rat. 

Once after a battle with a 'Bloodsucker, he was tired as a high school student. He discovered a Purple Rat in the Square Forest.

Unknown her name, "She like a sweet potato, like my Rat gun. Just call her Sweet Purple Potato Ball, idk...", he thought. And he brought her to his home(maybe?)

The rat is clever, actually she is a angle named Elliot. We don't know why her soul inside a rat. Forgive me, I am drunked.

She knows he is the 'Child of the Time. They may argue, may laugh. In my opinion, she lighten Ray's seemly colorless life.

Don't know how time flies, she made he faster in running, attacking. With the power of the 'Rat gun', he become the threating 'Speed King.
